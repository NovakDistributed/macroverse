/**
 * The Macroverse Star Registry keeps track of who currently owns virtual real estate in the
 * Macroverse world, at the scale of star systems and other star-like objects.
 *
 * Ownership is handled by having the first person who wants to own an object claim it, by
 * putting up a deposit in MRV tokens of a certain minimum size. Note that the owner of the
 * contract reserves the right to adjust this minimum size at any time, for any reason, and
 * without notice. Since the size of the deposit to be made is specified by the claimant,
 * trying to claim something when the minimum deposit size has been increased without your
 * knowledge should at worst result in wasted gas.
 *
 * Owners of objects can send them to other addresses, and an owner can abdicate ownership of
 * an object and collect the original MRV deposit used to claim it.
 *
 * Note that the claiming system used here is not protected against front-running. Anyone can
 * see your claim transaction before it is mined, and claim the object you were going for first.
 * However, they would then need to find it among the many billions of objects in the Macroverse
 * universe, because this contract only records ownership by seed.
 *
 * Note that ownership of a star system does not necessarily imply ownership of everything in it.
 * Just as one person can own a condo in another person's building, one person can own a planet in
 * another person's star system.
 *
 * All ownership is recorded using star seeds; no attempt is made to enforce that a given
 * seed actually exists in the Macroverse world. It is possible to purchase (and sell!)
 * nonexistent star systems, or star systems that you don't know where they are. Caveat emptor.
 *
 * The deployer of this contract reserves the right to supersede it with a new version at any time,
 * for any reason, and without notice. The deployer of this contract reserves the right to leave it
 * in place as is indefinitely.
 *
 * The deployer of this contract reserves the right to claim and keep any tokens or ETH or contracts
 * sent to this contract, in excess of the MRV balance that this contract thinks it is supposed to
 * have.
